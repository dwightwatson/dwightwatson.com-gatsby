Often when working on your front-end with Laravel Mix you’re going to want to import or reference some third-party code you’ve brought in through NPM/Yarn. Whether it’s JavaScript or some stylesheets, it’s painful and ugly to go through the whole `../../../node_modules/foo/bar/baz.xyz` routine. Luckily, there’s a better way.

## JavaScript

With JavaScript, Webpack will allow you to start off with the package name and then refer directly to the asset you’re after. In the following example I’m pulling the `collapse` and `dropdown` modules from Bootstrap simply prefixing the string with the package name `bootstrap-sass`.

```js
import &#039;bootstrap-sass/assets/javascripts/bootstrap/collapse&#039;;
import &#039;bootstrap-sass/assets/javascripts/bootstrap/dropdown&#039;;
```

## Sass

With Sass it’s a fairly similar process, except that you’ll prefix the string with a `~`. This just tells Sass you’re kicking off the path from `node_modules`. In this example I’m pulling in Bootstrap and Font Awesome.

```sass
@import &#039;~font-awesome/scss/font-awesome&#039;;
@import &#039;~bootstrap-sass/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap&#039;;
```
