Although a little old, I figured I&#039;d start posting up some of my open-sourced [CodeIgniter](http://ellislab.com/codeigniter) libraries. Some of these came from the [Studious](http://www.studiousapp.com) project, and others were for less-specific purposes.

This is a library for generating nice [Bootstrap](http://www.getbootstrap.com)-compatible breadcrumbs in CodeIgniter. It was developed for Bootstrap 2.x but the upgrade to the upcoming version 3 would be harmless if you needed.
