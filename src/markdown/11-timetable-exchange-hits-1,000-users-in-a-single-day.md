Just finished great week for [Timetable Exchange](http://www.timetableexchange.com) where we broke all our previous download records. [Student Services Australia](http://www.studentservices.com.au) helped launch a hugely successful campaign that saw the Timetable Exchange brand spread across universities all over the country for the first week of Semester 2.

On the 31st of July though, we had our biggest day by a long shot - 1,032 users from midnight to midnight. Could not be happier with the result, and we&#039;re hearing great things from our new users who love the app.

We&#039;re still working on some great new features for upcoming versions, and I&#039;m getting really excited to be able to announce them properly.
