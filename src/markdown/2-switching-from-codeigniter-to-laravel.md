I&#039;ve learnt a lot over the past year or so after spreading my wings from CodeIgniter. After toying with Ruby on Rails for a bit on a few projects and coming back to PHP I realised much of what we were missing over on this side. I began applying some of the patterns I had learnt to my new projects in an effort to improve them. When I discovered Laravel though, I was extremely excited to find much of what I loved about Rails to be available right here on PHP. Having used Laravel for a while now, I&#039;ve learnt how to apply everything I did in CodeIgniter in new and better ways, which has made me a better and faster developer.

I&#039;ve considered writing a little more on making the switch to Laravel from CodeIgniter, and discussing the various ways you can approach translating existing applications and techniques to this new framework. I&#039;m not entirely sure how I&#039;d go about such a thing, whether to do an eBook on the likes of Leanpub or a simple blog series. I assume there are enough people making the transition at the moment that such a series would be interesting... be sure to leave a comment if it&#039;s something you&#039;d like to see more of.
