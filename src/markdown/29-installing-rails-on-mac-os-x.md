Found a cool new resource, [Install Rails](http://installrails.com/), a site made by the team from [One Month Rails](http://www.onemonthrails.com/). If you're looking to get Rails installed on your machine I've started recommending this one - I've had some issues with [Rails Installer](http://railsinstaller.org/en) in the past, ranging from the installation not completing to various components not work which is just an awful experience for newcomers just trying to get it up and running. Futhermore, it's a little bit behind in terms of support for Ruby 2.0 and Rails 4.

Install Rails is a great walkthough to getting everything going, supports Mavericks already and the latest Rails already, and I personally think the hands-on install process gives users much more insight and control as to what is actually going on under the hood. It's still so annoying that I just can't run `gem install rails` on a new Mac and have it all work.
