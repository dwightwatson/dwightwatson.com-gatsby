While Laravel does come with a great facility for CSRF protection out of the box, it does actually need to be configured. By default, the `Form::open()` helper is going to drop the `_token` into your form to pass it along with the request so all you need to do is ensure that is it checked on the other side. Normally, you&#039;re going to want to check this on any request that is not idempotent, that is to say any request that is not of the `GET` method. The remaining methods mostly used in RESTful routing; `PATCH`, `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE` should all impact a change on the data in your application. For this reason they should all have CSRF protection applied to them, and there are a couple of ways to go about it in Laravel.

The first way is to implement the CSRF filter provided by Laravel within your routes file. You&#039;re welcome to go ahead an apply it to certain routes individually or different groups of routes as you see fit, but the easiest way (and only way I&#039;ll cover here) is just to pop this somewhere (probably at the top):

    Route::when(&#039;*&#039;, &#039;csrf&#039;, [&#039;delete&#039;, &#039;patch&#039;, &#039;post&#039;, &#039;put&#039;]);
	
What this will do is apply the CSRF filter to any request of any of the non-idempotent request types. The other way, which I&#039;m also a little fond of as it does provide a little more flexibility. We simply apply the filter into the `BaseController` contstructor.

    class BaseController extends Controller {
	    public function __construct()
		{
		    $this-&gt;beforeFilter(&#039;csrf&#039;, [&#039;on&#039; =&gt; [&#039;delete&#039;, &#039;patch&#039;, &#039;post&#039;, &#039;put&#039;]]);
		}
	}
	
This makes it easy to override in child controllers, and a part of me also feels that filters belong more in the controllers - but that could just be my Rails side coming out. Pick a way that works for you, as long as you are using CSRF protection as opposed to none at all!
