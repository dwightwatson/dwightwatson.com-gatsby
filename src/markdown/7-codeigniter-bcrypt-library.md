Bcrypt has become an imporant standard in password hashing as it&#039;s become clear that MD5 and SHA1 do not do enough to protect sensitive content. I&#039;m a big fan of Laravel requiring PHP&#039;s Mcrypt library to ensure that passwords are hashed correctly and hope that it brings about greater awareness of password protection in PHP applications and greater security of user data.

This library is a simple adaption of the portable PHPPass library for hashing passwords that better matches the CodeIgniter API and fits in easily as a library.
