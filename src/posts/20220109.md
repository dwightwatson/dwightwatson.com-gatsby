I've been using GitHub Actions more and more as a CI pipeline for my Laravel apps. Following a successful build on the master branch I want to deploy my apps to production which is now starting to be Laravel Vapor. The process is pretty easy.

First, [get an API key from Laravel Vapor](https://vapor.laravel.com/app/account/api-tokens) and add it as a secret to your GitHub project. I use `VAPOR_API_TOKEN` as the secret name. You can then reference the API key using the `${{ secrets.VAPOR_API_TOKEN }}` syntax and making it available as an environment variable when you deploy your app.

Finally, you can also pass through the commit ID and message so that Vapor's UI can better distinguish what was contained in the deployment.

```yml
name: Deploy

on: [push]

jobs:
  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/master'

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1

      - name: Setup PHP
        uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
        with:
          php-version: 8.1
          extensions: dom, curl, libxml, mbstring, zip, pcntl, pdo, sqlite, pdo_sqlite, gd, redis, memcached
          tools: composer:v2

      - name: Use Node.js 15.x
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: 15.x

      - name: Install composer dependencies
        run: composer install --prefer-dist --no-interaction --no-progress

      - name: Deploy to production
        env:
          VAPOR_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.VAPOR_API_TOKEN }}
        run: vendor/bin/vapor deploy production --commit="${{ github.event.head_commit.id }}" --message="${{ github.event.head_commit.message }}"
```

If you're deploying to multiple Vapor apps/environments you may consider using a [matrix](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstrategymatrix) which allows the jobs to run in parallel resulting in faster deployments. In the below example I use multiple Vapor manifests to deploy into two production environments at the same time.

```yml
  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/master'

    strategy:
      matrix:
        manifest: [vapor.yml, vapor.nz.yml]

    steps:
      //

      - name: Deploy to production
        env:
          VAPOR_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.VAPOR_API_TOKEN }}
        run: vendor/bin/vapor deploy production --manifest="${{ matrix.manifest }}" --commit="${{ github.event.head_commit.id }}" --message="${{ github.event.head_commit.message }}"
```
