Stripe webhooks can be a little bit annoying to verify. In Laravel I've generally done it using the `authorize` method of a FormRequest.

```php
use Exception;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Http\FormRequest;
use Stripe\Webhook;

class StripeRequest extends FormRequest
{
    /**
     * Determine if the user is authorized to make this request.
     *
     * @return bool
     */
    public function authorize(): bool
    {
        try {
            $signature = $this->header('Stripe-Signature');
            $secret = config('services.stripe.webhook_secret');

            Webhook::constructEvent($this->getContent(), $signature, $secret);
        } catch (Exception $e) {
            return false;
        }

        return true;
    }

    /**
     * Get the validation rules that apply to the request.
     *
     * @return array
     */
    public function rules()
    {
        return [
            //
        ];
    }
}
```

The implementation is simple enough: use Stripe to construct a Webhook event from the request and if an `Exception` is thrown you know it's invalid. You need to provide the webhook secret in order to build this event.

However, I've found that it's super easy to use [Laravel Cashier](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/billing) to do most of the legwork for you here, and you get a beautiful syntax for handing those webhooks too.

## Install Cashier

Run `composer require laravel/cashier` to install the package.

## Ignore Cashier's migrations

Call `ignoreMigrations` in a service provider to prevent the framework from automatically running Cashier's migrations next time you migrate.

```php
use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;
use Laravel\Cashier\Cashier;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function register()
    {
        Cashier::ignoreMigrations();
    }
}
```

## Add the API route

Register the route in `routes/api.php` - not your regular web routes file.

```php
Route::post('/webhooks/stripe', [App\Http\Controllers\WebhooksController::class, 'handleWebhook'])->name('cashier.webhook');
```

## Create the Webhook controller

Finally create a webhooks controller that extends Cashier's controller. You can then create methods that camelCase Stripe events and handle them - for example `checkout.session.completed` is mapped to `handleCheckoutSessionCompleted` and the payload is passed in as an argument.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Models\Checkout;
use Illuminate\Support\Arr;
use Laravel\Cashier\Http\Controllers\WebhookController as CashierController;

class WebhooksController extends CashierController
{
    /**
     * Handle checkout session completed.
     *
     * @param  array  $payload
     * @return \Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response
     */
    public function handleCheckoutSessionCompleted($payload)
    {
        $checkout = Checkout::where('stripe_checkout_session_id', Arr::get($payload, 'data.object.id'))
            ->firstOrFail();

        // Handle checkout
    }
}
```

Obviously there's a bit more code involved here than just using the custom `authorize` in a form request. However I like the simplification of being able to offload that (and the tests involved) to a well maintained first-party package, and get a fluent interface to handle events.
