Redis 6.x appears to require SSL for connections and that's a problem with Heroku. [Heroku does have documentation on how to get around errors with self-signed cerificates](https://help.heroku.com/HC0F8CUS/redis-connection-issues) but it falls short of addressing the solution specifically for Laravel apps.

```
Redis::connect(): SSL operation failed with code 1. OpenSSL Error messages:
error:0A000086:SSL routines::certificate verify failed
```

In `config/database.php` under the `redis` key you can control the options for your Redis connection. Here you can add a `context` which sets `verify_peer` and `verify_peer_name` to `false` so that the certificate issues are ignored. In the code below I've only applied these options in the production environment as it's not a concern for my local environment.

```php
    'options' => [
        'cluster' => env('REDIS_CLUSTER', 'redis'),
        'prefix' => env('REDIS_PREFIX', Str::slug(env('APP_NAME', 'laravel'), '_').'_database_'),
        'context' => env('APP_ENV') === 'production' ? [
            'stream' => [
                'verify_peer' => false,
                'verify_peer_name' => false,
            ],
        ] : [],
    ],
```
