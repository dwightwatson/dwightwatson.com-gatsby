For whatever reason [Laravel Vapor explictly does not publish your `site.webmanifest` file](https://github.com/laravel/vapor-cli/commit/30f55eff6ebc22e30796e9e033536894a28b0824), and it won't be ~~fixed~~ changed until the next major version. To get around this in the meantime you can add a route that simply serves the file from the public path (and optionally use the cache middleware).

```php
Route::middleware('cache.headers:public;max_age=2628000;etag')
    ->get('/site.webmanifest', fn () => file_get_contents(public_path('site.webmanifest')));
```
